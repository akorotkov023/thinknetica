# First Calculator

## Description

This is a simple calculator that I wrote in Elixir for Thinknetica.
For calculations, I implemented a lexer, a parser and an interpreter.


## Usage

Run `mix run -e First.Calc.main`:

```
$ mix run -e First.Calc.main
> 2 + 3
5
> 5 * 1
5
> ^C^C
```

## Tests

Run `mix test`:

```
